### Experiences Performing the WOD
Regarding the WOD itself, I found this to be the toughest one yet simply due to the fact that I felt I spent less kinetic learning with Javascript compared to the previous WODs (BrowserHistory 1-6). I'm not saying that I didn't read the materials but rather I learn through making mistakes and having to stare at the same wrong code to get it through to my head. However, I did realize that I was digesting the content and concepts at a significantly faster rate than compared to the previous WODs. 
I feel the aspects of the WOD that worked well were the improvements I made in diagnosing my errors. I realized that for example, whenever I would find a more efficient way in creating templates that I could copy/paste for products 2-5, I would miss an important detail such as changing the numbering in the items (item1 to item2, quantity1 to quantity2, etc.) I would get ahead of myself and while this worked well in preparing for steps down the road, I needed to work on focusing on the task currently at hand. I don't feel as if I stumbled on any specific part but it was definitely a shift from hard coding everything. 
This is really embarassing but a major error that slowed me down was not closing the Javascript comment (*/). I would forget to do this and after I created all the products and copied their corresponding information, I would see an error and have to restart, not knowing I should've just closed it. This happened once or twice. Another thing that slowed me down was copying the product information, so I thought I would search and replace. However, search and replace would have taken longer because once I copied a template, everything was going to be the same so when I replaced item1 with item2 for example, everything would be item2, I could not isolate it. 

### Preparation for the WOD
Preparation felt very routine at this point of the semester because in a month's time, we've completed 4 WODs, 5 including this one. I reviewed the corresponding lab which would be 5 & 6 for this WOD, and then read through the readings and took notes on the day before I attempted the WOD. What I did do differently was actually start on the WOD earlier on in the day. I don't like WODs because I'm a night owl and will start on any major assignment in the night. I realized mental health was important and decided to start earlier on in the day when the sun was still out. 
Another thing I did differently was not paying much attention to the video because I had studied the readings the night before. Keep in mind I still did the WOD about 5 days before the due date so I felt very relaxed because I was not rushed at all. Studying the readings and taking notes before while paying attention to the instructions helped me target what exactly I needed to understand while learning the overall concept of this module. 

### Changes for Future WODs
To be honest, this WOD felt the best even though it was by far the most difficult of the 5 I had done. I felt my preparation was on deck and starting the WOD not only earlier than the due date but earlier on in the day definitely gave me a sense of relief when it came to mistakes. I learned more because I could afford to spend extra time on it. 
If anything, I would try to learn the materials in better order as I did the WOD before I had finished Lab 6 because I noticed the Labs helped alongside the WODs. This time it couldn't be helped as the Lab was being updated with the class' progress and therefore took longer than usual to finish. 
I would also try to just start the WOD as soon as I see it being mentioned on the Dynamic Schedule. This is because I usually wait for the WOD to be announced through email because I find my classmates and I confused on whether or not the WOD was assigned or not. Now I know that WODs are inevitable so I would rather start as soon as I can because I had a midterm to study for and finishing that WOD earlier gave me more time for other classes. WODs take up a long amount of time even if they are meant to be workouts for the "day" and since we are all taking a full courseload, it's just beneficial for not only our grades in this class but our other courses as well.
